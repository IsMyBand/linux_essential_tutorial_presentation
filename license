#/brief_history_of_linux

"In 1991, Linus Torvalds developed a Unix-compatible kernel and called it Linux."
,
"It was proprietary at first,"
,
"but in 1992, he made it free software;"
,
"combining Linux with the not-quite-complete GNU system resulted in a complete free 
operating system"

#/gnu_1

"When I started working at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab in 1971, 
I became part of a software-sharing community that had existed for many years."
,
"As a member of this community, an AI Lab staff system hacker, my job was to improve this system."
,
"We did not call our software “free software”, because that term did not yet exist; but that is what it was."
,
"The collapse of the community"
,
"ITS were obsolete"
,
"The modern computers of the era, such as the VAX or the 68020, 
had their own operating systems, but none of them were free software "
,
"sign a nondisclosure agreement even to get an executable copy."
,
"This meant that the first step in using a computer was to promise not to help your neighbor"

#/gnu_2

"The rule made by the owners of proprietary software was, 
“If you share with your neighbor, you are a pirate. If you want any changes, beg us to 
make them.”
The idea that the proprietary software social system—the system that says you are 
not allowed to share or change software—is antisocial, that it is unethical, that it is simply wrong,"
and
"what was needed first was an operating system"
and
"make the system compatible with Unix"
and
"GNU's Not Unix"

"I therefore decided that my first program for the GNU Project would be a multilanguage, multiplatform 
compiler."
,
"I therefore decided that my first program for the GNU Project would be a multilanguage, multiplatform 
compiler."
,
"I concluded I would have to write a new compiler from scratch."
,
"That new compiler is now known as GCC; none of the Pastel compiler is used in it, 
but I managed to adapt and use the C front end that I had written. But that was some 
years later; first, I worked on GNU Emacs."

"Copyleft uses copyright law, but flips it over to serve the opposite of its usual purpose: instead of a means 
for restricting a program, it becomes a means for keeping the program free."
,
"The principal goal of GNU is to be free software."
,
"The specific implementation of copyleft that we use for most GNU software is the GNU General Public License, 
or GNU GPL for short."
,
"So we needed to use distribution terms that would prevent 
GNU software from being turned into proprietary software. The method we use is called “copyleft”."
