#/brief_history_of_linux

text
"In 1991, Linus Torvalds developed a Unix-compatible kernel and called it Linux. </li>
It was proprietary at first,
but in 1992, he made it free software;
combining Linux with the not-quite-complete GNU system resulted in a complete free 
operating system"

"how its start?"
and
"proprietary software, rule and idea"
and
"The collapse of the community"
and
"GNU/free operating system"
and
"Stallman and GNU"
and
"GNU Emacs"
and
"GCC"
